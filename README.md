### Stop Hacklore!

Hacklore is a blend of hacking and folklore—modern urban legends about digital safety. Hacklore spreads quickly and confidently, passed from person to person as if it were hard-earned wisdom. But like most folklore, it isn’t grounded in reality, no matter how plausible it sounds. Hacklore focuses on preventing dramatic, spy-thriller-style attacks, not the everyday threats the average person actually encounters.

Hacklore.org exists to separate myth from reality. Our goal is to help everyday people and small organizations focus on the simple, fact-based steps that truly protect their data and devices—keeping software up to date, using strong passwords and passkeys, using a password manager, and enabling multi-factor authentication. 

By replacing fear with facts, we can make digital safety advice more accurate, actionable, and effective for everyone.
